# Goal

Hardware controllers for [EmptyEpsilon](https://github.com/daid/EmptyEpsilon).

# Implementation

Each station is controlled by a [Raspberry Pi Pico](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/raspberry-pi-pico.html) which emulates a joystick for the OS.

Addionally the Helms stations includes a [Thrustmaster T.Flight Hotas X](https://www.thrustmaster.com/en-us/products/t-flight-hotas-x/) for maneuvering the spaceship.

# TODO
